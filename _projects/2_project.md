<h3 class="container-title"> Introduction </h3>
Image registration is a task aiming at finding a spatial transformation between two images to align them. In plain words, it aims to deform one image to reasonably resemble another image as closely as possible. The first image is referred to as the fixed image, serving as the target image. The second image is known as the moving image, which is intended to be registered or aligned with the fixed image. 

A registration is called rigid if the motion or change is limited to global rotations and translations, and is called deformable when the registration includes complex local variations. In clinics, rigid matching is appropriate for serial imaging of the skull, brain, or other rigidly immobilized sites. Deformable registration is appropriate for almost all other scenarios and is useful for many applications within medical research, medical diagnosis, and interventional treatments.

Image registration can be modeled as an optimization problem. In general, it has three components: a transformation model, a similarity metric and an optimization method. The goal of the optimization process is to find an optimal deformation field, which accurately describes how the voxels in the moving image have been displaced with respect to their original positions in the fixed image.

In this project, the B-spline registration was implemented, which uses B-spline curves to define a continuous deformation field that maps each voxel in a moving image to a corresponding voxel within a fixed or reference image. In the case of B-spline registration, the dense deformation field can be parameterized by a sparse set of control points which are uniformly distributed throughout the moving imageâ€™s voxel grid. The control points are free to move, the displacment vectors of other points are obtained by B-spline interpolation of these control point coefficients using piecewise continuous B-spline basis functions.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
